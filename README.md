# Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?
  - The client was Liam, the owner of DriverPass. He wanted to make system for online driving lessons to help students pass their drivers tests. 
# What did you do particularly well?
- I was able to include all of the needs of the client in the system. I was also able to successfully translate the system back to the client in a way they would understand and feel confident about. 
# If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
- I would re-do the business requirements documents. I feel like by the end of the course I understood the needs better than when I completed the business requirements document. While, I wouldn't complete scrap it I do think I could add to a lot of the points on the document like security, functional, and non-functional requirements. 
# How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
- It was important to keep the initial interview with me to reference at all points. Liam was very clear on what he wanted in the system to it was very helpful to refer back to. When it came to the user experience, I just pictured what I would do using the system. Starting with logging in, what it would look like on the home page, what I would click on next, etc. 
# How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?
- This course showed how important orginization is to building a system. I also think using different visual strategies to first design the system is important, it will point out flaws before you get into actually coding the system. While using UML diagrams may feel time consuming I do think that in the long run they will save the entire team time.
